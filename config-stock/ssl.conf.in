# SSL 
#
# In the wake of DSA-1571, Laurent Birtz and I decided on a way to
# support certificate changes on online services.  As of May 2008 KMOD
# will send a plain uint32 prior to the SSL connexion.  This is the
# number of the certificate he will be communicating with.  This is to
# be matched with that list of certificates and keys.  The server will
# load the certificate matching the one demanded by KMOD if he has it
# in his list.  We can then remove the certificate from the list when
# we want to revoke a certificate.
#
# As an added bonus for compatibility, I've made the server capable of
# accepting traditionnal SSL connection by using a default certificate
# when KMOD doesn't identify which one to use.  This keeps us
# compatible with pre-DSA-1571 version of the server.
#
# KPSes should not enforce a default certificate.  Other Teambox
# services using tbxsosd should.

ssl.keys = "1:$CONFDIR/ssl/tbxsosd.key";
ssl.certs = "1:$CONFDIR/ssl/tbxsosd.crt";

# NOTE: This is not a boolean.  This is the number of the certificate
# we have to use as default certificate for connexion that do not
# identify which certificate they want to use.
ssl.fallback_cert = "1";

# String selecting the mode of authentication to be used. 
#
# client: Send the certificate the client demands.  This will make tbxsosd
#         refuse connection from client not sending certificate identification
#         upon connection.
# fallback: Send the certificate the client demands if he demands one,
#           otherwise fallback to the default configured certificate. 
#           Implies allowing connection from client not sending certificate
#           identification on server connect.
# none: Always send the default configured certificate.
ssl.authentication_mode = "none";
