# FIXME: This option has been put here because there is currently no
# single configuration file for kctl.

# Set this to 1 if you want kctl to login using the current user
# credentials.  This is necessary on KPSes because kctl has to be used
# non-interactively in some places and because the default PostgreSQL
# authentication configuration validates that the username used to
# connect to the database is the same as the one the connection
# process is running under.
# In short, set this to 0 only if you know what you are doing.
